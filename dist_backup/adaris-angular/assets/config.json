Along with Krishna went many, including men of the Bhoja and Vrishni tribes, Dhrishtaketu, the king of Chedi country, and the Kekayas, who were all devoted to the Pandavas. They were filled with righteous indignation when they heard of Duryodhana’s perfidy and cried out that surely the earth would drink the blood of such wicked people. Draupadi approached Sri Krishna and, in a voice drowned in tears and broken with sobs, told the story of her wrongs. She said: “I was dragged to the assembly when I had but a single garment on my body. The sons of Dhritarashtra insulted me most outrageously and gloated over my agony.
